# Array Deletion at Different Positions in C

This repository demonstrates how to delete elements from an array at various positions in C. The program allows deletion of an element from the beginning, middle, or end of an array. Array deletion involves shifting elements to fill the gap created by the removed element.

## Introduction
In data structures, arrays store elements in contiguous memory locations. Deleting an element from an array involves removing the element at a specific index and shifting subsequent elements to the left to maintain the array's structure. This program demonstrates deletion at the following positions:
1. **Beginning**
2. **Middle**
3. **End**

## Features
- Delete an element at any position (beginning, middle, or end) in an array.
- Handles shifting of elements after deletion.

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of arrays in C.
- A C compiler (e.g., GCC).

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or copy the code from below.
2. Compile the code using a C compiler:
   ```bash
   gcc array_deletion.c -o array_deletion
./array_deletion

This `README.md` provides a comprehensive overview of how to delete elements at different positions in an array using C, along with proper indentation and code structure.
